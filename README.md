#Brew README

You can preview Brew at brewcoffee.herokuapp.com--currently, all the more difficult stuff is working, such as account creation, user authentication, and account management, as well as the BrewLog where you can store ratings and variables about different pots of coffee for future reference.

The instructional bit, where you can read precise directions for the different brewing paraphernalia will be coming soon.
