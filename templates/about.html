<h1>About 'Brew'</h1>
<p>Brew is a pet-project. I love coffee and know a few things about how to make it, but I often mix up all the different best practices for the different brewing techniques. This page is the result of my monkey-brain needing a clean, simple reference for all my coffee paraphernalia.</p>
<p>If you want to see more of my projects, feel free to checkout my GitHub, and if you want to reach out, feel free to shoot me a message below.</p>
